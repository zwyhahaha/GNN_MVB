CODE REVIEW: `run_logistic_mkp.py`

1. what is `t`?
2. what is the MIP class? `mkp`: define the knapsack problem. 
3. code stricture

for each MIP scale (m,n,t)
    get pre-generated MIP dataset
    define mvbsolver

    train mvbsolver on train dataset and save model (.pkl file)
    
    for each test (single instance?)
        define grbmodel
        set mvbsolver with grbmodel, and add MVB cut
    
        solve problem using grbsolver -> original info
        solve problem using mvbsolver -> mvb info

4. whenIsBestObjFound?
5. how to **evaluate** the results?

CODE REVIEW: `logisticUtils.py`

1. define logisticTrainer and logisticPredictor.
2. for trainer, using sklearn.fit for each *variable*.

CONCLUSION

1. compare the time of finding the best solution: `OTime` and `MVBTime`, in log_all_warm file.
2. i think it is more convenient to write within the current framework.
3. only need to define `gnnUtils` and (`gnnTrainer`, `gnnPredictor`)

1. graph data missing
2. graph generated in `data_generation.py`
3. `presolve` needs to be called to get graph
4. successfully generated graph data

PIPELINE
- [x] START: given problem class indset and network config
- [x] READ: instance from data/instances/indset
- [x] READ: graph from data/graphs/indset
- [x] LOAD: model from trained_models/indset/train_1000_4
- [x] PREDICT: probability (n,2) and prediction (n,)
- [x] SOLVE: original MIP instance
- [x] SOLVE: original MIP with warm start
- [x] MVB: add cut using probabilities given by gnn
- [x] SOLVE: mvb_model

1. redefine `getMultiVarBranch()` to receive external args. shape of Xpred? (n,1) probs[:,1]
2. COPT not supported? solved

## 0103 record

1. how to warm start copt by predictions. round and fill variable values. âˆš
2. callback? -> use gurobi

- [x] warm start copt model
- [x] get solving time for each model
- [ ] use the best config of gnn

## 0105 record
- [x] gurobi license and test

## 0106 record
- [x] gurobi callback: copy model and use global vars, and use objnow and objbst for comparison
- [x] build experiment env
- [x] generate target dataset

DATASET
1. `indset`: independent set, decide whether to include a node, such that an edge is not included, and maximize the cardinality
2. `setcover`: set covering, decide whether to include a set, such that the union is the universe, and minimize the number of sets
3. `cauctions`: combinatorial auctions, decide whether to allocate a subset of product to a buyer, and maximize the value
4. `fcmnf`: Fixed-Charge Multi-Commodity Network Flow: decide the flow, minimize the total cost with fixed charge
5. `gisp`: generalized independent set problem: divide into removable and unremovable edges. max the revenue - remove cost

- [x] fix min problem
- [x] set param Heuristics as 1

## 0109 record
- [x] run cauctions dataset: unbalanced upper and lower bound, and a hidden threshold in code? sort
- [ ] implement logistic regression model, how to generate the train dataset for logreg? perturb fcmnf
- [x] rerun setcover by removing the upper cut
- [x] solve four subproblems

## 0115 record
- [x] fix a bug in braching rule. >= a vs. <= (a-1)
- [x] use different probability for up and low cut
